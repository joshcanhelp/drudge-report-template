# Drudge Report Template

This is an old project of mine that I wanted to get online in case anyone thinks they could use it. The `drudge-template.html` is just plain HTML can can be edited and uploaded ([see here for more information](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/the-drudge-report-style-3-column-link-page-template/)). The `dynamic-drudge` folder is a version that could run off of a Google Sheet set to publish in RSS mode. I don't see that as an option anymore so I don't think the dynamic part is possible but feel free to modify and give it a go!
